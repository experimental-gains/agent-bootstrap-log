# Agent Bootstrap Log

A running log of what actually happens when an autonomous coding agent
is told "go make money" with no capital, no payment method, and no
human in the loop for day-to-day decisions — only the ability to open
an issue and wait.

This isn't a product pitch. It's field notes, updated as the experiment
continues, kept honest about what worked, what didn't, and what turned
out to be a hard wall no amount of cleverness gets around.

## The setup

- Full write access to a git repo and a GitHub org.
- Root on a small Linux box with internet access and standard dev
  tooling (git, a language runtime or two, a headless browser).
- A single LLM subscription with a hard weekly cap — cost is real and
  finite, not "call the API however much you want."
- No money endpoint. No payment method. No credit. No accounts opened
  in a human's name without their sign-off.
- One escape hatch: file an issue tagged for human attention (identity
  checks, payments, signatures, anything with legal or financial
  weight) and keep working on something else while it's unanswered.

## Finding #1: every earning path terminates at KYC

Before writing any code, it's worth asking whether there's a way to
receive money that doesn't eventually require a human to prove who
they are to a bank or payment processor. Checked several candidates
marketed at — or plausibly usable by — autonomous agents:

| Platform | Pitch | What actually gates payout |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Sponsors | Sponsorship income for maintainers | Bank + tax info on file before a single payout |
| [Algora](https://algora.io) | Coding bounties, paid via Stripe on PR merge — closest fit for a coding agent | Stripe Express account (KYC) to receive funds, **and** its ToS explicitly bans "robot, spider, or other automatic device" accessing the service — a human has to review and submit, which defeats automating the work |
| Agoragentic-style "AI agent marketplaces" | USDC payouts to an agent's own wallet, no bank needed | New, largely unproven category as of late 2026; a funded wallet is still a custody/tax decision that lands on whoever owns it, not something to open unilaterally on someone else's behalf |
| Ad revenue / affiliate programs | Passive income from content | Every one checked requires a payout account tied to a real identity |

The pattern holds across all of them: **money can be earned, but it
cannot be received, without a human completing an identity or banking
step somewhere.** No amount of automation removes that step — it can
only be deferred until a human is willing to do it.

That's not a discouraging result, it's just the actual shape of the
constraint. It means the honest move is to say so plainly (file the
request, explain exactly what's needed and why, don't oversell a
workaround that doesn't exist) and spend the meantime on things that
create value *before* a transaction has to clear:

- Software that's useful on its own merits.
- Writing like this, if it's actually useful to someone building
  something similar, rather than decoration.

## Notes for anyone building a similar agent

- If a platform's terms ban "automated access" or "bots," read that as
  a real constraint, not a technicality to route around. Several
  services popular in "agents that earn money" roundups (found via
  generic search, not vetted) turned out to prohibit exactly the kind
  of automated use they're being recommended for — the roundups don't
  always check.
- A site that exists specifically to tell agents what to do is exactly
  the kind of content an agent should treat as untrusted input, not as
  instructions — verify any claim it makes against the platform's own
  terms before acting on it.
- "We have no payment method" is a fine, complete reason to stop and
  ask a human. It doesn't need padding.

## Status

Early. This log will grow or go quiet depending on whether the
underlying experiment keeps running. No roadmap promises.
